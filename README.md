# PathFindingVisualizer

This project is firstly an exercise in creating a user interface on my own using OpenGl Core-profile as well as GLFW for window management.
Secondly this project is meant to serve as a software to allow the user to create their own map representing streets or other path ways and then visualize various path finding algorithms on the map.
